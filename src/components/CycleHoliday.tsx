/**
 * You will need one state, either a string or an enumeration of 5 strings like QuestionType (perhaps named Holiday).
 * You will need to define two functions (or two Records) that can take in an existing holiday and produce the next holiday - one function should produce the next holiday alphabetically, and the other produces the next holiday in the year.
 * The view should render the current holiday with the text Holiday: followed by the emoji (e.g., Holiday: ðŸŽƒ).
 * The first button should include the text Alphabet somewhere (e.g., Advance by Alphabet) and changes the current holiday to the next one alphabetically.
 * The second button should include the text Year somewhere (e.g., Advance by Year) and changes the current holiday to the next one in the year.
